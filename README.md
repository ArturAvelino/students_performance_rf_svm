# students_performance_rf_svm
A Data Visualization and Model Comparison Project between the Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. 

The project has the objective of verifying if the student's background influences the performance in the final exams and the creation of a model to predict what the student's written score would be. 

Finally, I'll compare two models that two models that I believe would fit this data set.
